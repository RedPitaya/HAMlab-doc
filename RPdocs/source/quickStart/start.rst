   blank SD cards. To properly preapare it please follow the steps in the Prepare SD card paragraph.    
    
This is the most common and recommended way of connecting and using your Red Pitaya STEMLab boards. Your LAN network 
needs to have DHCP settings enabled which is the case in majority of the local networks,  whit this,  simple “plug and
play”  approach is enabled. Having STEMLab board connected the local network will enable quick access to all Red 
Pitaya applications using only your web browser. Simply follow this 3 simple steps:

    
    1. Connect power supply to the Red Pitaya STEMlab board
    2. Connect STEMlab board to the router or direc to the PC ethernet socket
    3. Open your web browser and in the URL filed type:   ``rp-xxxxxx.local/``
       
.. note::

    ``xxxxxx`` are the last 6 characters from MAC address of your STEMlab board. MAC address is written on the 
    Ethernet connector.
