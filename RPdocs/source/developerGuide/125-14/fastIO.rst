Analog inptus & outputs calibration
***********************************

.. TODO: New Oscilloscope&Signal bad link

Calibration processes can be performed using New Oscilloscope&Signal generator app. or using calib command line 
utility. When performing calibration with the new Oscilloscope&Signal generator application just select 
Settings->Calibration and follow instructions.

    - Calibration using calib utility
    
Start your Red Pitaya and connect to it via `Terminal <http://redpitaya.com/faq-page/#>`_.

.. code-block:: shell-session
   
    redpitaya> calib
 
    Usage: calib [OPTION]...
    
    OPTIONS:
     -r    Read calibration values from eeprom (to stdout).
     -w    Write calibration values to eeprom (from stdin).
     -f    Use factory address space.
     -d    Reset calibration values in eeprom with factory defaults.
     -v    Produce verbose output.
     -h    Print this info.

The EEPROM is a non-volatile memory, therefore the calibration coefficients will not change during Red Pitaya power 
cycles, nor will they change with software upgrades via Bazaar or with manual modifications of the SD card content. 
Example of calibration parameters readout from EEPROM with verbose output::

    redpitaya> calib -r -v
    FE_CH1_FS_G_HI = 45870551      # IN1 gain coefficient for LV (+/- 1V range)  jumper configuration.
    FE_CH2_FS_G_HI = 45870551      # IN2 gain coefficient for LV (+/- 1V range)  jumper configuration.
    FE_CH1_FS_G_LO = 1016267064    # IN1 gain coefficient for HV (+/- 20V range) jumper configuration.
    FE_CH2_FS_G_LO = 1016267064    # IN2 gain coefficient for HV (+/- 20V range) jumper configuration.
    FE_CH1_DC_offs = 78            # IN1 DC offset  in ADC samples.
    FE_CH2_DC_offs = 25            # IN2 DC offset  in ADC samples.
    BE_CH1_FS = 42755331           # OUT1 gain coefficient.
    BE_CH2_FS = 42755331           # OUT2 gain coefficient.
    BE_CH1_DC_offs = -150          # OUT1 DC offset in DAC samples.
    BE_CH2_DC_offs = -150          # OUT2 DC offset in DAC samples.

Example of the same calibration parameters readout from EEPROM with non-verbose output, suitable for editing within 
scripts::

    redpitaya> calib -r
           45870551            45870551          1016267064          1016267064 

You can write changed calibration parameters using **calib -w** command:
1. Type calib -w in to command line (terminal)
2. Press enter
3. Paste or write new calibration parameters
4. Press enter

.. code-block:: shell-session
   
    redpitaya> calib -w
        40000000           45870551          1016267064          1016267064 

Should you bring the calibration vector to an undesired state, you can always reset it to factory defaults using::

    redpitaya> calib -d

DC offset calibration parameter can be obtained as average of acquired signal at grounded input. Gains parameter can 
be calculated by using reference voltage source and old version of an Oscilloscope application. Start Oscilloscope
app. connect ref. voltage to the desired input and take measurements. Change gain calibration parameter using 
instructions above, reload the Oscilloscope application and make measurements again with new calibration parameters. 
Gain parameters can be optimized by repeating calibration and measurement step. 

In the table bellow typical results after calibration are shown.

AC gain accuracy can be extracted form Frequency response - Bandwidth given in Figure: 
`Fast Analog Inputs Bandwidth <http://wiki.redpitaya.com/index.php?title=File:Bandwidth_of_Fast_Analog_Inputs.png>`_.

OUTPUTS
=======

Calibration is performed in noise controlled environment. Inputs and outputs gains are calibrated with 0.02% and
0.003% DC reference voltage standards. Input gains calibration is performed in medium size timebase range. Red Pitaya
is non-shielded device and its inputs/outputs ground is not connected to the earth grounding as it is in case of 
classical Oscilloscopes. To achieve calibration results given below, Red Pitaya must be grounded and shielded.

.. Table: Typical specification after calibration

================= ==========
Parameter         Value
================= ==========
DC GAIN ACCURACY  0.4%
DC OFFSET         +/- 4 mV
RIPPLE(@ 0.5V DC) 0.4 mVpp
================= ==========
